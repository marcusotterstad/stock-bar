# A stock market bar website created using the PERN stack

## This idea came to me after discovering bars that behave as stock markets, with prices that fluctuate as supply and demand differ. My goal for this project is to create an easy to use user interface for drink orders, a well documented API that is easy for developers to use, an intuitive and efficient website for employees to recieve and complete orders, and a secure website for developers and managers to see performance, efficiency, prices, etc.
